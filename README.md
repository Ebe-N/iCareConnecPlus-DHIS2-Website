# iCareConnecPlus-DHIS2-Website
These are the source codes containing the description of the Practical Training assignment that I was assigned to do which was to design the basic structure of the iCareConnec+ website using angular.
The website consists of a home or a landing page which gives description to clients and users on the resources and services that are available in the iCareConnec+ and how they can have access to the resources through registration. 
It also contains the pricing description for different packages with different services based on time so that Users who will require to start using iCareConnec+ can choose a number of services and resources they require so far in their facility and pay in accordance to time to have the access.
